# Project Task Completion List

### Links

[Project Tasks and Status](https://github.com/users/realatc/projects/1)
[Issues List](https://github.com/realatc/Baang-Cleaning-Services/issues)

### Overview

Both links above should take you to a list of requirements for our grade on the project. I felt it would be a good idea to put this out there so that we can update and keep an eye on everything needed within the project.

I figured this could be a good way for us to keep track of all the requirements for the project and grading. On the project list, you will see there are four(4) categories listed: No Work Required - FYI, Tasks Needed, In Progress, and Done.


As you update and merge your branches to the master, keep an eye out on this board and mark things done so we can keep an eye on missing items.

### Working From Project List

- Move one of the items from the tasks needed column into this category, by clicking and dragging over.
- Then, click into the link of the task you moved (Ex: Click on: Chapter 2: HTML Fundamentals...etc...).
- Click Add Assignee and check next to your name.
- Click the "x" to leave.

Same rules apply when moving from "In Progress" to "Done", except you do not need to go into the link and update the checkmark or anything. Just drag over to done.

Then, as part of our final review, I added a "Verified by Team" Column. Goal is to have one other person check and verfy that this particular task was in completetd and someone else verified. 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

### Working from Issues Tab

Issues tab - located with other tabs from main page.

Once there, click into a specific issue.

- Feel free to update with any comments based on what you were doing or working on.
- On the right hand side, please go ahead and update the Status accordingly (In progress, Done, Verified By Team).

Either process should end with the same result. Again, let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
