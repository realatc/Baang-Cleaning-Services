Steps

1. Go to your branch (if you haven't made one yet, do: code tab > drop down where it says main > type in name > click on link that came up).
2. Confirm you are on your branch now, then click on file you are working on.
3. Click on pencil to edit file.
4. Made changes/add to file.
5. Add Comments down in the bottom describing what you did and why (dont get crazy - one to two sentances is totally fine).
6. Click Commit changes.
7. Go back to your main/code tab.
8. Click on pull request prompt/alert near the top.
9. Review to make sure you haven't changed your mind on the changes performed.
10. Click Create Pull request.
11. If you feel really sure that it is all good, go ahead and click "Merge pull request".
12. And because the system knows you are just so confident in the changes made, go ahead and click "Confirm Merge"

That should be it!
